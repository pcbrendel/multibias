Title: Simultaneous Multi-bias Adjustment
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Paul Brendel
Maintainer: Paul Brendel <pcbrendel@gmail.com>
Description: Quantify the causal effect of a binary exposure on a binary 
    outcome with adjustment for multiple biases. The functions can 
    simultaneously adjust for any combination of uncontrolled confounding, 
    exposure misclassification, and selection bias. The underlying method 
    generalizes the concept of combining inverse probability of selection 
    weighting with predicitve value weighting. Simultaneous multi-bias 
    analysis can be used to enhance the validity and transparency of 
    real-world evidence obtained from observational, longitudinal studies.
