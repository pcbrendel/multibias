Title: Simultaneous Multi-Bias Adjustment
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Paul Brendel
Maintainer: Paul Brendel <pcbrendel@gmail.com>
Description: A tool for those attempting to quantify the effect of a binary exposure on a binary outcome.  
    It simultaneously adjusts for any combination of uncontrolled confounding, exposure misclassification, 
    and selection bias via a weighted outcome regression.  The weight reflects the probability of the 
    missing data and serves to 'reconstruct' the unbiased data that could have been observed based on the 
    assumed nature and degree of the biases.  This approach combines the methods of predictive value
    weighting and inverse probability of selection weighting.
