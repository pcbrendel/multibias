\title{Simulated data with uncontrolled confounding and exposure misclassification}
\format{
A dataframe with 100,000 rows and 5 columns:
\describe{
    \item{Xstar}{misclassified exposure, 1 = present and 0 = absent}
    \item{Y}{outcome, 1 = present and 0 = absent}
    \item{C1}{1st confounder, 1 = present and 0 = absent}
    \item{C2}{2nd confounder, 1 = present and 0 = absent}
    \item{C3}{3rd confounder, 1 = present and 0 = absent}
}
}
\usage{
df_uc_emc
}
\description{
Data containing two sources of bias, three known confounders, and
100,000 observations. This data is obtained from \code{df_uc_emc_source}
by removing the columns \emph{X} and \emph{U}. The resulting data
corresponds to what a researcher would see in the real-world: a
misclassified exposure, \emph{Xstar}, and missing data on a confounder
\emph{U}. As seen in \code{df_uc_emc_source}, the true, unbiased
exposure-outcome odds ratio = 2.
