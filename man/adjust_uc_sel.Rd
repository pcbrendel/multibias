\title{Adust for uncontrolled confounding and selection bias.}
\usage{
adjust_uc_sel(
  data_observed,
  data_validation = NULL,
  bias_params = NULL,
  level = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_observed}{Object of class \code{data_observed} corresponding to the
data to perform bias analysis on.}

\item{data_validation}{Object of class \code{data_validation} corresponding to
the validation data used to adjust for bias in the observed data. Here, the
validation data should have data for the same variables as in the observed
data, plus data for the confounder missing in \code{data_observed}. There
should also be a selection indicator representing whether the observation in
\code{data_validation} was selected in \code{data_observed}.}

\item{bias_params}{Object of class 'bias_params'}

\item{level}{Value from 0-1 representing the full range of the confidence
interval. Default is 0.95.}
}
\value{
A list where the first item is the odds ratio estimate of the
effect of the exposure on the outcome and the second item is the
confidence interval as the vector: (lower bound, upper bound).
}
\description{
\code{adjust_uc_sel} returns the exposure-outcome odds ratio and confidence
interval, adjusted for uncontrolled confounding and exposure
misclassificaiton.
}
\details{
Bias adjustment can be performed by inputting either a validation dataset or
the necessary bias parameters. Values for the bias parameters
can be applied as fixed values or as single draws from a probability
distribution (ex: \code{rnorm(1, mean = 2, sd = 1)}). The latter has
the advantage of allowing the researcher to capture the uncertainty
in the bias parameter estimates. To incorporate this uncertainty in the
estimate and confidence interval, this function should be run in loop across
bootstrap samples of the dataframe for analysis. The estimate and
confidence interval would then be obtained from the median and quantiles
of the distribution of odds ratio estimates.
