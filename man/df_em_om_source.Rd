\format{
A dataframe with 100,000 rows and 7 columns:
\describe{
    \item{X}{true exposure, 1 = present and 0 = absent}
    \item{Y}{outcome, 1 = present and 0 = absent}
    \item{C1}{1st confounder, 1 = present and 0 = absent}
    \item{C2}{2nd confounder, 1 = present and 0 = absent}
    \item{C3}{3rd confounder, 1 = present and 0 = absent}
    \item{Xstar}{misclassified exposure, 1 = present and 0 = absent}
    \item{Ystar}{misclassified outcome, 1 = present and 0 = absent}
}

\description{
Data with complete information on the two sources of bias, three known
confounders, and 100,000 observations. This data is used to derive
\code{df_em_om} and can be used to obtain bias parameters for purposes
of validating the simultaneous multi-bias adjustment method with
\code{df_em_om}. With this source data, the fitted regression
\ifelse{html}{\out{logit(P(Y=1)) = &alpha;<sub>0</sub> + &alpha;<sub>1</sub>X + &alpha;<sub>2</sub>C1 + &alpha;<sub>3</sub>C2 + &alpha;<sub>4</sub>C3}}{\eqn{logit(P(Y=1)) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X + \alpha_2 C1 + \alpha_3 C2 + \alpha_4 C3}}
shows that the true, unbiased exposure-outcome odds ratio = 2.
