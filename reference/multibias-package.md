# multibias: Multiple Bias Analysis in Causal Inference

Quantify the causal effect of a binary exposure on a binary outcome with
adjustment for multiple biases. The functions can simultaneously adjust
for any combination of uncontrolled confounding, exposure/outcome
misclassification, and selection bias. The underlying method generalizes
the concept of combining inverse probability of selection weighting with
predictive value weighting. Simultaneous multi-bias analysis can be used
to enhance the validity and transparency of real-world evidence obtained
from observational, longitudinal studies. Based on the work from Paul
Brendel, Aracelis Torres, and Onyebuchi Arah (2023)
